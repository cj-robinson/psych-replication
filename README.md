# Pyschology Replication Crisis

Find the story here: [cj-robinson.github.io/replication-crisis](https://cj-robinson.github.io/jeopardy/)

This was an assignment for our Data Studio class at Columbia Journalism School's Data Journalism program, intended to think about how to create end-to-end data stories about topics of our choosing on deadline.

## Introduction and Goals

This project explores the replication crisis that has gripped the pyschology field for the past 15 years. Attempts to replicate long-held hypotheses were constantly failing due to a confluence of factors explored in the piece. The crisis has spurred a large overhaul in the scientific community as transparency becomes increasingly important.

I've always been interested and skeptical of pop pyschology. I remember attempting to power pose before interviews after seeing Amy Cuddy's TED Talk, and I was even more intrigued reading news about the academic debates surrounding these seemingly 'revolutionary' ideas. During college, I worked in a pyschology lab attempting to measure how 'priming' participants could change their perceptions, and as I learned more about statistics and testing in work, the more I doubted the whole system. 

My reporting questions were largely centered around:
1. Just how bad is the replication crisis and how can we measure it? 
2. Does a failed replication have any effect? 
3. How are pyschologists dealing with the fallout?
